# big_data

This respository offers an introductory guide to working with big data in R developed for the Rutgers' Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science's spring 2020 data club. It focuses mostly on the use of the `data.table` package. 

This tutorial requires users to have R and RStudio installed. Additionally, users should install the `data.table` package, `tidyverse` package, and `mlbench` package into R.
